                     Welcome to DC/AC circuit Program

     Firstly->The uints are in(ohm,farad,Henry,Ampere,Volt,Degree),so donot forget to Tranform 
units before entering inputs.Program will ask you to enter omega,number of nodes(not including
node zero),then number of all elements in circuit by given instructing in program. 



Note:There is not dependent Sources,no independent current Sources.
